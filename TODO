BUGS
------
- movie.sql always results in the last movie appearing twice (although, Postgres
  will take care of this, I think, by rejecting the second one)

TASKS
------
- do not store &frac12 for example int the database--have the scripts (php or
  javascript) deal with those characters when displaying with HTML
- create FiLTH logo and film graphic background image
- gather data
  - mpaa ratings
  - oscar nominees
  - lists
- mini programs for (table):
  - extract movies from filmographies into movie table sql insertions (movie)
  - (workedon)
  - turn genre.txt into sql (genre)
  - (genrecontains)
  - turn oscar.txt into sql (oscar)
  - (oscargivento)
  - (list)
  - (listcontains)
- make lists into html to be linked to from home page
- finish php pages
  - add <!DOCTYPE at top of pages
  - use style sheets rather than html style attributes
- the titles returned from a query can be displayed as links to imdb.com, like
  so:

  http://www.imdb.com/find?s=titles&q=the+shawshank+redemption
