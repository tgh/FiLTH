 # The purpose of this file (which is automatically imported in the base
 # freemarker configuration--see filth-servlet.xml) is to create a library of layout macros
 # under a single freemarker namespace (e.g. layout.standard, layout.error, etc)
 # without the maintenance and readability hassles of having them all in the
 # same source file.
 #
 # ONLY include files in here that contain exactly 1 macro and nothing else.
