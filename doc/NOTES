WHERE LEFT OFF
---------------
- working on oscars...
  - oscarsOfCategory.csv
    - looks like only 1929 lists studio before title
    - titles with a ',' are double-quoted
    - 1968 best actress has a tie which needs a value of 2, not 1
    - need to remove studios
    - need to remove character names
    - need to remove producers
    - mulitple recipients need their own lines (with 3 as status, where 3 = shared?)


NEEDS
------
- country table needs to be populated in the db first, followed by movie, all
  other entities, then relationships


IDEAS/THOUGHTS
---------------
- crewperson lname and mname can be NULL, so names such as Cher and Madonna
  would be last names.
- for the web app, the lists will be pdf files linked from the home page (?)
- if you don't care about having multiple countries per movie (which I don't at
  this point), you could change the movie table back to having the country a
  varchar(30) column and not a fkey into a country table (with a big check
  constraint, mind you, for all countries).  This will eliminate a table join
  but at the expense of using more space.
- shouldn't contain accented special characters for names, movie titles, etc.
  because typing in a search query in the front-end won't find them if not
  given (just using non-accented characters).  Unless search by pull-down menu?


HELPFUL HINTS/REMINDERS
------------------------
- compile haskell just like common gcc: ghc -o [binary] [source]
