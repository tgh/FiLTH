WHERE LEFT OFF
---------------
- was updating "Hannah" to "Hanna" and received this output:

  (21:49)tgh:~/Projects/FiLTH/scripts[master]$ ./movie.sh 

  Did not find <"Hanna" (2011) **½ [PG-13] USA> in the database.
  Is this an update? (y/n) y

  What is the id of the movie? 704
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/home/tgh/Projects/FiLTH/scripts/movie2sql.py", line 230, in <module>
      insert = not checkForUpdate(title, year, stars, mpaa, country.replace("'",""))
    File "/home/tgh/Projects/FiLTH/scripts/movie2sql.py", line 140, in checkForUpdate
      search  = "'{0}', {1}, '{2}', '{3}', '{4}'".format(origTitle.encode('utf-8').replace("'","''").replace("/","\/"), origYear, origStars.encode('utf-8').replace("*","\*"), origMpaa, origCountry)
  UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2 in position 2: ordinal not in range(128)

- pass in db name and password through command-line when running movie.sh
  so that models.py can use them and can be unignored in .gitignore
- fixing unicode issues with movie2sql.py and models.py...
- need scripts to parse filmographies for worked_on table

- The Magdalene Sisters not in database?
- Gerry should be 2002
- Old School not in db?
- The Station Agent should probably be ***1/2, not ****
- sorting on star_rating has undesired results now that it is test rather than
  integer.  use "C" locale???

- change "Hannah" to "Hanna"

- replace DELETE FROM ... with TRUNCATE in drop_and_... scripts


NEEDS
------
- all entity tables need to be inserted before any relationship tables


IDEAS/THOUGHTS
---------------
- change list_contains pkey? (I'm sure there's going to be some lists that have
  the same movie on it 2 or more times...)

- for the web app, the lists will be pdf files linked from the home page (?)

- shouldn't contain accented special characters for names, movie titles, etc.
  because typing in a search query in the front-end won't find them if not
  given (just using non-accented characters).  Unless search by pull-down menu?
  EDIT: there are search mechanisms (at least in Postgres) that WILL catch these
  accented characters I think...

- add category to oscar_given_to table and make it a foreign key to the
  oscar table (like country is to movie) to eliminate another join.  This will
  add significant storage, however. (ditto for tyler_given_to)

- rather than run psql straight on oscar_given_to.sql, should drop_and_...sh
  scripts run OscarParser first, then run oscar_given_to.sql?


HELPFUL HINTS/REMINDERS
------------------------
- password for filth database: 0o9..

- to connect to the database with psql:

  $ psql -U postgres -d filth

- compile haskell just like common gcc: ghc -o [binary] [source]
- example of full text search in postgres:

  SELECT mid, title FROM movie WHERE to_tsquery('Dr.&Strangelove&Bomb')
  @@ to_tsvector(title);
  -- the '@@' operator means 'matches'
  -- to_tsquery has special characters:
  --  & = and
  --  | = or
  --  ! = not

- example of search for name with accented character using the created function
  to_ascii():

  select * from crew_person where f_name =
  to_ascii(convert_to('Penélope', 'latin1'), 'latin1');

- crew persons with one name (e.g. Cher, Costa-Gavras) have their names in the
  db as last names

- in Postgres, the output of an insert is:
  "INSERT <OID of the new row> <the number of rows inserted>"
  e.g.
  INSERT 0 1
