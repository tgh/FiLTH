WHERE LEFT OFF
--------------
- updated movie script and movie2sql.c for new schema, however, gcc compiler is
not compiling the c file and giving a lot of weird errors AND DELETING THE FILE!


THOUGHTS
---------
- crewperson lname and mname can be NULL, so names such as Cher and Madonna
  would be last names.

- for the web app, the lists will be pdf files linked from the home page (?)
