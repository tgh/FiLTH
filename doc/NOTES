WHERE LEFT OFF
---------------
- working on oscars...
  - oscarsOfCategory.csv
    - 1968 best actress has a tie which needs a value of 2, not 1
    - some nominees from 1928-1930 were nominated for more than one movie in the
      same nomination
    * might want to check my movie lists to make sure these are in the right
      year:
      - Pollock
      - The Hurricane
      - Before Night Falls
      - Wag the Dog
      - I Am Sam


NEEDS
------
- all entity tables need to be inserted before any relationship tables


IDEAS/THOUGHTS
---------------
- crewperson lname and mname can be NULL, so names such as Cher and Madonna
  would be last names.
- for the web app, the lists will be pdf files linked from the home page (?)
- shouldn't contain accented special characters for names, movie titles, etc.
  because typing in a search query in the front-end won't find them if not
  given (just using non-accented characters).  Unless search by pull-down menu?
  EDIT: there are search mechanisms (at least in Postgres) that WILL catch these
  accented characters I think...
- can have the Front-End take care of certain constraints when inserting/
  updating new data (movie year is between 1900 and 3+ years from current year,
  for example).  When adding a country, or star rating, or something like that,
  the check constraint must be updated (e.g. the range of values accepted).
  If sqlite is used, however, this is not possible.  So, one way is to remove
  the check constraints in the database, and use the front-end to check input
  before insert/update.  For a value range upper limit that might change (e.g.
  when adding a new country), the FiLTH application could to a sql query upon
  load for the highest value of movie.country and store that in a variable, or
  have some sort of config or rc file that it reads/updates for such variables.


HELPFUL HINTS/REMINDERS
------------------------
- to connect to the database with psql:

  $ psql -U postgres -d filth

- compile haskell just like common gcc: ghc -o [binary] [source]
- example of full text search in postgres:

  SELECT mid, title FROM movie WHERE to_tsquery('Dr.&Strangelove&Bomb')
  @@ to_tsvector(title);
  -- the '@@' operator means 'matches'
  -- to_tsquery has special characters:
  --  & = and
  --  | = or
  --  ! = not

- example of search for name with accented character using the created function
  to_ascii():

  select * from crew_person where f_name =
  to_ascii(convert_to('Pen√©lope', 'latin1'), 'latin1');
