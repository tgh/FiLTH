WHERE LEFT OFF
---------------
- working on oscars...
  - oscarsOfCategory.csv
    - looks like only 1929 lists studio before title
    - titles with a ',' are double-quoted
    - 1968 best actress has a tie which needs a value of 2, not 1
    - need to decode ampersand escape sequences
    - need to remove studios
    - need to remove character names
    - need to remove producers


NEEDS
------
- country table needs to be populated in the db first, followed by movie, all
  other entities, then relationships


IDEAS/THOUGHTS
---------------
- crewperson lname and mname can be NULL, so names such as Cher and Madonna
  would be last names.

- for the web app, the lists will be pdf files linked from the home page (?)


HELPFUL HINTS/REMINDERS
------------------------
- compile haskell just like common gcc: ghc -o [binary] [source]
