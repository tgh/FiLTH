WHERE LEFT OFF
---------------
- working on oscars...
  - should there be another attribute in oscar_given_to indicating that the
    nomination is shared?  Maybe be an integer representing how many others it
    is shared with

  - add a non-found hashMap

  - will need user interaction when movie/crew not in db:
    Example:

      "A Passage to India" not found. Title OK? y

      Shirley MacLaine not found.  Name OK? y

      "The Betrayal (Nerakhoon)" not found. Title OK? n
        Enter new title: The Betrayal

      Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita not found. Name OK? n
        Ignore this person? n
        Enter first name (or 'i' to ignore): Pat
        Enter middle name (or 'i' to ignore): i
        Enter last name: Morita

      Donald Kaufman not found. Name OK? n
        Ignore this person? y
        Donald Kaufman ignored.

      "Mongol" from Kazakhstan not found. Title OK? y
        Country OK? y

      "Solomon and Gaenor" from United Kingdom not found. Title OK? y
        Country OK? n
        Enter country name: England

NEEDS
------
********************************************************************************
- IMPORTANT: most (all except some requesting oscar data?) queries need
  "...WHERE star_rating NOT NULL..." due to the "The Battle of Algiers" problem.
  The Battle of Algiers was nomiated for oscars in both 1966 and 1968.  Since
  years are attached to movies and not oscars, The Battle of Algiers has a year
  of 1966, and thus cannot have a 1968 oscar nomination.  Thus, a dummy record
  has been made: (DEFAULT, 'The Battle of Algiers', 1968, NULL, NULL, NULL,
  NULL).  Other movies have also been cloned with a dummy varible for the same
  reason.  Since these are the only records with a NULL star_rating value,
  queries should have '...star_rating NOT NULL...' if dummy records are to be
  ignored.
********************************************************************************

- all entity tables need to be inserted before any relationship tables

- should probably add notes about the release year of the dummy record movies


IDEAS/THOUGHTS
---------------
- crewperson lname and mname can be NULL, so names such as Cher and Madonna
  would be last names.
- for the web app, the lists will be pdf files linked from the home page (?)
- shouldn't contain accented special characters for names, movie titles, etc.
  because typing in a search query in the front-end won't find them if not
  given (just using non-accented characters).  Unless search by pull-down menu?
  EDIT: there are search mechanisms (at least in Postgres) that WILL catch these
  accented characters I think...
- can have the Front-End take care of certain constraints when inserting/
  updating new data (movie year is between 1900 and 3+ years from current year,
  for example).  When adding a country, or star rating, or something like that,
  the check constraint must be updated (e.g. the range of values accepted).
  If sqlite is used, however, this is not possible.  So, one way is to remove
  the check constraints in the database, and use the front-end to check input
  before insert/update.  For a value range upper limit that might change (e.g.
  when adding a new country), the FiLTH application could to a sql query upon
  load for the highest value of movie.country and store that in a variable, or
  have some sort of config or rc file that it reads/updates for such variables.


HELPFUL HINTS/REMINDERS
------------------------
- password for filth database: 0o9..

- to connect to the database with psql:

  $ psql -U postgres -d filth

- compile haskell just like common gcc: ghc -o [binary] [source]
- example of full text search in postgres:

  SELECT mid, title FROM movie WHERE to_tsquery('Dr.&Strangelove&Bomb')
  @@ to_tsvector(title);
  -- the '@@' operator means 'matches'
  -- to_tsquery has special characters:
  --  & = and
  --  | = or
  --  ! = not

- example of search for name with accented character using the created function
  to_ascii():

  select * from crew_person where f_name =
  to_ascii(convert_to('Pen√©lope', 'latin1'), 'latin1');
