- a mystarrating of NULL could mean 'not seen' and the program could interpret
  that as 'not seen' and display/act accordingly rather than actually storing
  a 'not seen' string.

- crewperson lname and mname can be NULL, so names such as Cher and Madonna
  would be last names.

- for the web app, the lists will be pdf files linked from the home page (?)
