-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

History
--------
This project began as a school assignment in the Fall of '09.


Overall Description
--------------------
The goal of this project is to create a program that manages my movies--movies
I have seen, movies I want to see, filmographies, oscar winners/nominees, best-
of lists, etc--all in one place, rather than multiple documents.

In the end I hope it to be a GUI application with menus, buttons, forms, etc.
and/or a web app that will let others search the database for my ratings.


Source
-------
Code consists of C, Python, Haskell, and bash scripts.
Database is Postgresql.
Web pages in php.


Files
------
/bin (binary files)

  /tylerhayes/tools/
    
    Contains compiled java code from tylerhayes.tools.jar from my JavaTools
    project.  Used for logging in java programs such as /bin/OscarParser, as
    well as its database "virtual console".

  genre2sql

    Parses the file given as its only argument and produces sql insert
    statements for the database's genre table.  To be used with /data/genre.txt
    as its argument.  Use shell redirection to store the sql statements into
    /sql/genre.sql.  Compiled from /src/genre2sql.hs Haskell source file.

  nameFormatter

    Takes a text file containing a list of names (such as /data/crewperson.txt)
    and outputs those names in a (lastname, firstname) format.  Takes the name
    of the file to parse (/data/crewperson.txt) as its only argument.  Used in
    /scripts/crewperson.sh which redirects the output to a temp file (in /temp),
    which is then used as an argument to /scripts/crew2sql.py.  Compiled from
    /src/nameFormatter.hs Haskell source file.

  oscar2sql

    Parses the file given as its only argument and produces sql insert
    statements for the database's oscar table.  To be used with /data/oscar.txt
    as its argument.  Use shell redirection to store the sql statements into
    /sql/oscar.sql.  Compiled from /src/oscar2sql.hs Haskell source file.

  OscarParser.class

    Parses the /data/oscarsOfCategory.csv file (that is produced by
    /scripts/oscarGivenTo.sh), and produces the /sql/oscar_given_to.sql file.
    Takes two arguments: name of Postgres database, and password of database.
    Used in the /scripts/oscarGivenTo.sh shell script.  The purpose of this
    program is to produce sql insert statements to populate the oscar_given_to
    table in the database as much as possible based on the oscar data in the
    /data/oscarsOfCategory.csv file.  These statements are written to the
    /sql/oscar_given_to.sql file.
