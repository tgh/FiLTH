History
--------
This project began as a school assignment in the Fall of '09.


Overall Description
--------------------
The goal of this project is to create a program that manages my movies--movies
I have seen, movies I want to see, filmographies, oscar winners/nominees, best-
of lists, etc--all in one place, rather than multiple documents.

In the end I hope it to be a GUI application with menus, buttons, forms, etc.
and/or a web app that will let others search the database for my ratings.


Source
-------
Code consists of C, Haskell, and bash scripts.
Database is Postgresql.
Web pages in php.
