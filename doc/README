-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

History
--------
This project began as a school assignment in the Fall of '09.


Overall Description
--------------------
The goal of this project is to create a program that manages my movies--movies
I have seen, movies I want to see, filmographies, oscar winners/nominees, best-
of lists, etc--all in one place, rather than multiple documents.

In the end I hope it to be a GUI application with menus, buttons, forms, etc.
and/or a web app that will let others search the database for my ratings.


Source
-------
Code consists of Python, Java, Haskell, bash scripts, and of course SQL.
Database is Postgresql.
Web pages in php (for now).


Files
------
/bin (binary files)

  tylerhayes/tools/
    
    Contains compiled java code from tylerhayes.tools.jar from my JavaTools
    project.  Used for logging in java programs such as /bin/OscarParser, as
    well as its database "virtual console".

  genre2sql

    Parses the file given as its only argument and produces sql insert
    statements for the database's genre table.  To be used with /data/genre.txt
    as its argument.  Use shell redirection to store the sql statements into
    /sql/genre.sql.  Compiled from /src/genre2sql.hs Haskell source file.

  nameFormatter

    Takes a text file containing a list of names (such as /data/crewperson.txt)
    and outputs those names in a (lastname, firstname) format.  Takes the name
    of the file to parse (/data/crewperson.txt) as its only argument.  Used in
    /scripts/crewperson.sh which redirects the output to a temp file (in /temp),
    which is then used as an argument to /scripts/crew2sql.py.  Compiled from
    /src/nameFormatter.hs Haskell source file.

  oscar2sql

    Parses the file given as its only argument and produces sql insert
    statements for the database's oscar table.  To be used with /data/oscar.txt
    as its argument.  Use shell redirection to store the sql statements into
    /sql/oscar.sql.  Compiled from /src/oscar2sql.hs Haskell source file.

  OscarParser.class

    Parses the /data/oscarsOfCategory.csv file (that is produced by
    /scripts/oscarGivenTo.sh), and produces the /sql/oscar_given_to.sql file.
    Takes two arguments: name of Postgres database, and password of database.
    Used in the /scripts/oscarGivenTo.sh shell script.  The purpose of this
    program is to produce sql insert statements to populate the oscar_given_to
    table in the database as much as possible based on the oscar data in the
    /data/oscarsOfCategory.csv file.  These statements are written to the
    /sql/oscar_given_to.sql file.

/data (data files in various formats used to populate the database)

  actedin.txt

    Basically filmographies of a small handfull of actors--formatted in such a
    way to make parsing easier for scripts and programs.  This file will be used
    (as of now, 6/1/11, it has not been used) to help populate the worked_on
    table of the database.

  crewperson.txt

    A list of as many actors, directors, cinematographers, and writers as I
    could think of that I care about or think I would need in some way.  This
    file is to be used with the scripts/crew2sql.py Python script as a
    command-line argument--the result of which is sql insert statements to
    populate the crew_person table of the database.  The sql output of the
    Python script has been redirected to produce the /sql/crew_person.sql file.

  crewperson_accented.txt

    The same as the file above but with special characters for accented letters
    such as would be in Pen√©lope Cruz.  It is still undecided as to whether the
    database will contain accented characters or not (ticket #47).

  directed.txt

    Filmographies of directors formatted like a list in the same way as
    /data/actedin.txt to make parsing easier for scripts and programs.  This
    file will be used (as of now, 6/1/11, it has not been used) to help populate
    the worked_on table of the database... or maybe not.  Filmographies.doc
    may be used instead (see /data/Filmographies.doc).

  Filmographies.doc

    An old Word document I still maintain for director filmographies.  Both
    /data/actedin.txt and /data/directed.txt came from this document.  This will
    most likely be used (with the help of antiword to convert it from a Word
    document to a text file) to help populate the worked_on table of the
    database.  Either that or converted to directed.txt, which will then be
    used.

  genre.txt

    A simple list of genres I am intereseted in for the database.  This file is
    to be used with the /bin/genre2sql program as a command-line argument, whose
    output is sql insert statements to populate the genre table in the database.
    This output has been redirected to produce the /sql/genre.sql file.

  Movie_Ratings.doc

    Here is the document that got it all started.  This document (a Word
    document) lists all of the movies I have rated, along with their year,
    country, and MPAA ratings.  I thought not only would it be nice if there was
    a way to have new movie ratings be inserted appropriately automatically, but
    also if this data I was maintaining and perusing by hand could be queryable.
    Thus, FiLTH.  Of course, it has grown to include much more than the data
    that this document provides.  antiword is used to convert this document to
    plain text in the /scripts/movie.sh shell script, and then taken from there.
    (see /scripts/movie.sh)

  oscar.txt

    A list of the Oscar categories that I care about.  This file is used with
    /bin/oscar2sql program as a command-line argument, whose output is sql
    insert statements that populate the oscar table in the database.  This
    output has been redirected to produce the /sql/oscar.sql file.

  oscars.csv

    Raw data (in CSV format) of Oscars history from 1928-2008.  This file was
    found at this site: http://www.aggdata.com/awards/oscar, which was linked to
    from this site: http://www.bloggersblog.com/blog/224081.  The file contains
    all cateogories (even the specific name changes to the same categories),
    production companies, producers, character names, etc--in other words, a lot
    of stuff I don't want/need.  This file is used in the
    /scripts/oscarGivenTo.sh shell script where fgrep, grep, and sed are used to
    extract and massage what I want out of the data.  The resulting cleaned data
    is stored in /data/oscarsOfCategory.csv.  (see /scripts/oscarGivenTo.sh)

  oscarsOfCategory.csv

    This is a cleaned version of the data found in /data/oscars.csv, and used in
    the /scripts/oscarsGivenTo.sh shell script.  This data will be used to
    populate the oscar_given_to table in the database by being given to the
    /bin/OscarParser Java program as a command-line argument, which will then
    output sql insert statements to be redirected to produce
    /sql/oscar_given_to.sql.

  otherMovies.txt

    An ad hoc list of movies I have seen a long time ago, but have not been
    reviewed (and, thus, not in the Movie_Ratings.doc document).  As of now
    (6/1/11) this file is not in use for FiLTH.

  shot.txt

    Filmographies of cinematographers listed in the same format as actedin.txt
    and directed.txt.  This file will be used (as of now, 6/1/11, it has not
    been used) to help populate the worked_on table of the database.

  wrote.txt

    Filmographies of screenwriters listed in the same format as actedin.txt,
    directed.txt, and shot.txt.  This file will be used (as of now, 6/1/11, it
    has not been used) to help populate the worked_on table of the database.

/doc (documentation)

  ER_diagram.dia

    This file graphically illustrates the Entity-Relationship diagram of FiLTH's
    database schema.  The file can only be opened with the open source program,
    Dia.

  front_end_requirements.txt

    Notes on what capabilites/functionalities are desired for FiLTH's user
    interface.

  NOTES

    Text file that acts as a kind of scratch pad for various notes regarding the
    FiLTH project.

  README

    This file.

  tickets.ods

    An OpenOffice spreadsheet containing the status of all open (and closed)
    tickets for the FiLTH project.

/gui (files pertaining to the user interface of FiLTH)

  [currently empty]

/images (image files)

  filth_logo.png

    The logo for FiLTH created in Photoshop.  The background is transparent.

/jar (any necessary .jar (JavaARchive) files go here)

  javacsv.jar

    Small Java library for reading/writing CSV files.  This API is used in
    /src/OscarParser.java and is required to compile and run /bin/OscarParser.
    (see /scripts/cop.sh and /scripts/runop.sh for compiling and running
    /bin/OscarParser)

  postgresql-8.4-701.jdbc4.jar

    API for connecting to a PostgreSQL database in Java.  This is used in
    /src/OscarParser.java and is required to compile and run /bin/OscarParser.

  tylerhayes.tools.jar

    A small collection of Java code that I have written and maintain.  It is
    mostly used for the Log API for logging events/data during the execution of
    a program (useful for debugging, for example).  The code is kept under
    another Git repository on gitHub.com (tgh/JavaTools).  Whenever code has
    been added/removed/changed in JavaTools, scripts/update_jar.sh is run to
    update this file.  When cop.sh is run, this code is also (unintentionally)
    compiled into /bin/tylerhayes/tools.

/scripts (as in programming scripts, not movie scripts)

  cop.sh

    Shell script that compiles /src/OscarParser.java into /bin/OscarParser.class

  crew2sql.py

    Python script that produces sql insert statements to populate the
    crew_person table of the database given a specifically formatted text file
    of names in the film industry.  This script is not used directly--it is used
    in the /scripts/crewperson.sh shell script (see below).

  crewperson.sh

    Shell script to populate the crew_person table of the database.  It first
    executes /bin/nameFormatter to format the names in /data/crewperson.txt and
    then feeds the output of nameFormatter to the /scripts/crew2sql.py Python
    script to produce the sql insert statements.  That output is then redirected
    to /sql/crew_person.sql.
